## **üí° How It Works**

### **1. Upload Your PDF**
Upload your PDF file, and the system will extract the text using **PyPDF2** for further processing.

### **2. AI-Driven Conversation**
Once the text is extracted, the **Google Gemini 1.5** AI model interprets the content, allowing users to engage in natural language queries about the document.

### **3. Summarize Your Document**
The AI analyzes the document and provides a concise summary in **HTML** format, organized by key sections like topics, findings, and data.

### **4. YouTube Search Integration**
If more information is required, the AI integrates with YouTube to search for relevant video content related to the PDF.

### **5. Annotate & Highlight PDF Content**
As users interact with the AI, they can **annotate** and highlight sections of the PDF. This creates a dynamic, interactive document review experience.

### **6. Code Generation**
For technical documents, the AI can generate **working code** based on the content, parsing algorithms, equations, and other programming-related information.

### **7. Switch Between Themes**
Toggle between **light mode** for a clean, bright interface or **dark mode** for those who prefer a more subdued and eye-friendly design.
